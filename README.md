SDK doctor helps diagnose application-server-side connectivity issues with your Couchbase Cluster (among other things)...

### How To Use
Simply invoke the doctor with the `diagnose` sub-command and a valid connection string (including specifying a bucket name!).

```bash
sdk-doctor diagnose couchbase://127.0.0.1/default
```

It is recommended that you use the actual connection string from your planned application.


### How To Build
The build steps are similar to most go programs.  Given a properly set up go build environment:

```
$ go get https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-doctor
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-doctor
$ go build
$ ./sdk-doctor -h
```
